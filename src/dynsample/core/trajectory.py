    A record of the several states through which a dynamical system

    Parameters
    ----------
    times: NDArray
        A one-dimensional array containing the successive times at
        which the several states are reckoned.

        Its shape is (n_steps,).

    values: np.ndarray
        An array containing the state of the whole system at every
        recorded time.

        Its shape is (n_steps, n_nodes, n_features).

        The first dimension distinguishes one time from each another;
        the second, one node from another; and the third, the several
        features belonging to each node.
